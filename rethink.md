## RethinkDB Table Idears

### auth

Stores 3 items/document:

* display name
* code
* expiration

### cards

Stores all of the card data.

Would be nice if could find a way to store the cards the user owns as well in here.  Or somewhere else.

### heroes

Stores all of the hero data (tbd: how to provide base stats for each hero)

### decks

Simple storage of an account's decks.  Maybe not necessary.
